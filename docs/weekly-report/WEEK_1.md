# Narrative

During the first week of development, the primary focus was on creating a functional and user-friendly ToDo list application. The process began with designing the frontend using HTML and CSS. The goal was to create a clean, intuitive interface that would allow users to easily add, edit, and delete tasks.

**HTML & CSS**: The initial step involved structuring the HTML to define the layout of the ToDo list. This included creating input fields for new tasks, a list to display existing tasks, and buttons for task management actions. CSS was then used to style these elements, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design.

**JavaScript**: With the frontend in place, the next step was to implement the core functionalities using JavaScript. This involved writing scripts to handle user interactions, such as adding new tasks to the list, marking tasks as complete, and removing tasks. JavaScript was also used to integrate the Gemini feature, enhancing the overall user experience with additional interactive elements.

**Django**: On the backend, Django was utilized to manage data storage and retrieval. A database was set up to store the tasks, and Django's robust framework facilitated the creation of APIs for interacting with the frontend. This ensured that all task-related data was securely stored and could be efficiently accessed and manipulated.
